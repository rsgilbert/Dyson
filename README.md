# Dyson-Homework
Dyson's java files where she works on the Scanner to solve an interesting problem.

This project includes two source files. Dyson.java and UserLG.java. They were both created and written by Dyson when she was learning Java under supersion by me, Gilbert.
The Dyson.java file is about calculating the maximum value using a for loop and the Scanner class. The UserLG is background knowledge about scanning user inputs from the Standard input stream. We use the inputs scanned to calculate and print their total.

All in all, it was a day well spent!
